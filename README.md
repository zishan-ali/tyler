## ðŸ™‹ Feature Requests

  - [**Step 1**](#create-an-issue) Create an issue to inform the maintainers and other contributors about what you're working on.
  
  - [**Step 2**](#fork-the-repository) Fork the repository, develop and test your code changes and add any relevant documentation. Ensure that your commit messages describe the changes.
  
  - [**Step 3**](#make-a-pull-request) Make a pull request.

### Create an Issue

Scour the issues for an issue similar to what you'd be working on prior to starting a discussion. It's possible that someone else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that the functionality exists already.

If not, [click here](https://github.com/zishan-ali/tyler/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to create a ticket for a feature request.

There is no style guide as of yet but attempt to keep your code as clean as possible and follow conventions already set out in the existing codebase.

### Fork the Repository

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request, and ensure coverage hasn't suffered. Also update any documentation relvant to the changes you've made.

### Make a Pull Request

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation, make a pull request against the main branch of the repository. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request - with either `Refs #400` or `Closes #400`.
